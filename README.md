A Simple Site
=============

Being my first repo, this is a simple site I pushed out of myself to show what I can do to myself. This exists as more of a reminder of where I started and not really any use of because I plan to make it modern useful interactions that are lacking my this current design. This site uses no javascript or even jquery. I will include a link to this site on the new one, showing how I started and the change my designs went through. All in all, there isn't much to get out of this site compared to others on the web.
