  I am the author and designer of this site, it was made more for practice than education about running. It was my first project and looks to be in a redesign phase until I make my portfolio and put that into permanent redesign. I'm an 18 year old kid who decided not to goto school and pursue a career in different computer careers with my end goal being a job in IT. With this site I want to accomplish a begining of a freelance web designer career and show this off to people I know so I can say I have been doing actual work in the year I didn't do much. This design is very basic and expect changes with colors, fonts, and other odds and ends that will be experimented on. The pictures on this site have been taken without permission and the sites they came from will be sourced. The pictures used in the Why, Benefits, and Cool People sections where all from a race report which is located here.
