  The obvios benefits are exercise and feeling good about yourself any time besides a raceday. There are good people to meet and nice views to see as well. Exploring is a nice way to spend a run too, it does feel dangerous from animals and nature.

  Running will give you some nice legs and good health comes out of any exercise. An old plus that comes out of running is the ego boost, finishing races, hard runs, and the times you look back and see everything you ran past that pushes a smile out when your legs are jelly. There is also the runners high, to me it's an incredible focus that lets me forget that I am running, chase some thoughts down and figure out how anything. Completing the list is seeing nice views, it doesn't have to be too nice because I'm tired and relax in the sun shine.
