  Trasitioning into a marathon runner from a general runner requires some displine that comes from running a few years or maybe just a person who can run without worrying too much. One general accomplishment in order to run a marathon is running a 20 miler. It tells you how you feel when running distance and most of what you need to know. Pacing should be looked at as well as comfort, because an important part of distance running is lubing up since chafing hurts. Starting out at the very begining is different, really only adding how to enter running and then following the transition. To start off, just run for some minutes and let your body hurt, stretch a bit then do the same the next day or day after and up your distance to maybe a mile or so. I really can't say much about it other than a little basic tips. If there was one thing I wouldn't be worried about too much is some problems, my arches hurt so I rolled a tennis ball over every night I ran and hoped it'd get better then it turns out one way of stretching ended the pains. Other times it could be terrible like tendonitis, a good tip is don't overdo training.
