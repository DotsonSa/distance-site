  Any race that is run includes the feeling of becoming a superhuman, the race implants an idea that you can do any and everything. During the course it dies down as people pass you who didn't go out too strong. This feeling happens in all races, for marathons there are other obstacles. Dehydration, calorie intake, and pacing are important are very different than other races. In marathons it's okay to walk a bit, maybe a steep uphill to keep some energy for the easy downhill. Water isn't so hard, just make sure to stay hydrated throughout the week and drink to thrist the day before, so just drink a cup or two every pit stop or more. As for calories, this is a difficult subject to discuss without knowing metabolism and such, for myself I ate terribly and hit the wall pretty hard. I didn't carbo-load and ate little during the race. Things to eat would be carb and suger foods, so pretty much the food they have at the tents.
