  From meeting people during races and runs to just hearing about some crazier ones running the tour de france or finishing 100 mile races.

  Cool people are easy to find while running. During races or even runs, they can help by telling about their experiences and how they solved them. There is a lot of odd stuff that can be done for running, ice baths, and a good amount of stretching that magically works, finding out about them are difficult on your own. They can also give out tips on routines or places they run to make running easier. Other times cool people are just nice, friendly, and probably a little odd.
