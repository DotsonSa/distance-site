  I ran a marathon, honestly what I have to say about is that is was fun only after I did it. Maybe at the begining, mostly it was raining while I was tired from getting up at 6am. I didn't carbo-load or really eat anything during the race, I feel multiple times and my hands were numb. At the end I looked down at my legs, a small gash on my knee from falling somewhere and mud covering half of my legs. One thought that easily kept me going is that I'm running a marathon. As an 18 year old I have something I can be proud about without doubt, it hangs on my wall so I can turn my head and see something cool.

  There are plenty of reasons to get into marathon or distance, really though it's best if you are interested. The sights are pretty nice, but you could just hike. Just getting into for exercise is slightly overkill because running 5k and 10ks is good enough. I had run for an hour or two before, and found that I liked it a bit too much. I could bike for two hours and then run one then finish up by biking home, which is another two hours. Doing that showed me how much fun it is just biking and running. I honestly don't know my exact reasons for getting into it besides I liked more than other things.
